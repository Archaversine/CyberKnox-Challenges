Challenges for CyberKnox

## How this works

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition that challenges 
participants to find and exploit vulnerabilities in simulated systems in order 
to locate "flags." These flags may be digital tokens or codes that can be 
captured by completing certain tasks or solving puzzles.

To solve a challenge, simply go to its folder on the repo and read the README
there. It will have a description and maybe a hint to guide you in the right
direction. Once you have found a flag, verify it [here](https://archaversine.github.io/CyberKnox-Challenges/).
As of now, this currently only tells you if your flag is correct, and does not
keep score for you. Eventually, this repo will be attached to firebase to
provide a leaderboard.

All flags will be of the format `cyberknox{some_stuff_here}`. Sometimes a flag
may not have the `cyberknox{}` wrapper around it and you will have to add it
yourself. To get started, here is your first challenge: `hello_world`. 
(Don't forget the wrapper!)
